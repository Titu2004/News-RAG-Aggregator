The News Article Aggregator using Simple RAG is a beginner-friendly Python project that collects live news articles from multiple online sources using RSS feeds.

The system performs:

News collection from different sources

Topic grouping based on keywords

Query-based retrieval of the most relevant article

Simple summarization of retrieved news

This project demonstrates the core concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in a simplified manner by retrieving relevant information before generating an output.
